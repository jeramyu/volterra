### 1.4 Rainbow Bar Gradient

The rainbow bar gradient is an approved and intentional Volterra element.

**Stops**

- 20: Sage
- 40: Peach
- 60: Coral
- 80: Butter

The gradient functions as an **editorial signature**, not a visual effect.

## 2. Typography

Typography decisions prioritize readability, restraint, and editorial clarity over visual expressiveness.

### 2.1 Font Family

- **Inter**

### 2.2 Weight Usage

**Website / Digital Pages**
- Headers: ExtraLight or Light
- Body text: ExtraLight or Light
- Emphasis and labels: Regular or Semibold (used sparingly)

**Editorial Content (Reports, Briefs, PDFs)**
- Headers: ExtraLight
- Body text: ExtraLight  
- Regular may be used selectively for tables, captions, footnotes, and clarity
- Emphasis: Regular or Semibold, used minimally

Light body text in editorial content is intentional. It supports long-form reading, reduces visual noise, and reinforces an editorial, institutional tone rather than a marketing one.

### 2.3 Base Text Size

- Website body text: approximately **15px** (≈ 11pt equivalent)
- Reports and PDFs: true **11pt** (or equivalent)

Line spacing and paragraph spacing are prioritized over font size increases.

### 2.4 Typography Principles

**Do**
- Use spacing instead of heavier weights
- Allow paragraphs to breathe
- Keep hierarchy calm and deliberate

**Don’t**
- Bold full paragraphs
- Center long text
- Use all-caps except for very small labels

### 2.5 Section Title Accents

Certain section titles may use a rainbow underline as a visual accent.

The underline functions as a typographic marker, reinforcing hierarchy and editorial rhythm rather than acting as a decorative divider.

**Usage Guidelines**
- The rainbow underline appears directly beneath the section title text
- It should be thin, restrained, and shorter than the full text width
- Best suited for major section titles on long-form pages

**Do**
- Use the underline to signal important transitions in the narrative
- Pair with generous whitespace above and below the heading
- Treat the underline as a subtle signature element

**Don’t**
- Use the underline on small or tertiary headings
- Animate the underline
- Use the underline as a replacement for layout spacing

## 3. Layout, Grid, and Spacing

### 3.1 Grid Philosophy

- Single primary content column
- Left-aligned content
- No masonry layouts or asymmetry

The layout should feel editorial and institutional, not promotional.

### 3.2 Spacing System

All spacing follows multiples of **8px**.

Typical vertical rhythm:
- Section padding: **64–80px**
- Component spacing: **24–32px**
- Inline spacing: **8–16px**

If something feels tight, add space before increasing font size.

### 3.3 Cards and Containers

- Subtle borders (`#E5E7EB` or equivalent)
- Borders are optional; whitespace is preferred. Use rules only when structure requires it.
- Very light shadows only when necessary
- Square or very lightly rounded corners
- No blur effects. No glassmorphism.
