| Title | About Volterra |
| Body | Volterra Advisors is an advisory platform focused on the decisions that shape data center and digital infrastructure outcomes.

The firm exists to address a recurring gap in the market: critical decisions are often made with incomplete context—about power, entitlement risk, timing, or capital alignment—long before those assumptions are tested. When those gaps surface later, they are expensive to unwind.

Volterra works at the intersection of power, land, capital, and market dynamics to bring clarity early, reduce rework, and keep execution aligned as conditions evolve. The focus is not volume or activity, but durable decisions that hold up under pressure. |

| Title | Led by Jeramy Utara |
| Body | Volterra is led by Jeramy Utara, an industry veteran with nearly two decades of experience across the full data center lifecycle—from site selection and power strategy to leasing, development, and execution.

Jeramy began his career at DuPont Fabros Technology, contributing to the development of some of the earliest hyperscale data center campuses in North America. He later joined CloudHQ as its first employee, helping grow the company from concept to one of the world’s leading privately held data center developers.

Over more than a decade at CloudHQ, Jeramy worked directly across development, leasing, and transaction execution—engaging hyperscale, cloud, and enterprise platforms on projects where power, timing, and scale were decisive.

That experience shapes how Volterra operates today. Engagements are senior-led and judgment-driven, with teams assembled to fit the specific technical, market, and execution needs of each opportunity. Rather than maintaining a fixed staff, Volterra builds the right bench for the problem at hand—engineers, advisors, and specialists whose expertise aligns with what actually matters to the decision.

| Title | How Volterra Works |
| Subtitle |The Volterra Model |
| Body | Volterra is intentionally structured differently from traditional consultancies.

Rather than maintaining a large permanent staff, Volterra assembles the right team for each engagement—drawing on a deep network of trusted engineers, developers, utility specialists, and advisors whose expertise aligns with the problem at hand.

This structure keeps work senior-led, highly focused, and aligned with client outcomes rather than billable volume. |
| Subtitle | How We Work |
| Body | Volterra engagements are designed to reduce noise and keep decisions moving.

That means direct senior involvement from day one, clear problem framing before solutioning, early identification of constraints, and recommendations tied to real-world execution paths.

The objective is not to produce volume, but to accelerate confident decision-making. |
| Subtitle | Who We Work With |
| Body| Volterra works with:

– Data center developers and operators
– Landowners evaluating data center potential
– Investors and capital partners
– Emerging platforms entering new markets
– Established players navigating growth constraints

Engagements are selective and collaborative. Volterra works best where trust, transparency, and momentum matter.
