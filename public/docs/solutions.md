### 2. Advisory Philosophy

**Copy**
| Type | Copy |
|------|------|
| Title | Advisory Philosophy |
| Body | Volterra’s work is guided by a simple principle:
clarity creates momentum.

In data center development, delays and missteps rarely come from lack of effort. They come from unclear assumptions—about power timelines, entitlement risk, capital readiness, or who actually owns the next decision.

Volterra engagements are structured to surface those constraints early, reduce decision friction, and align stakeholders around a credible path forward. The goal is not more analysis, but fewer surprises—and execution that holds up when timelines and capital are under pressure.

The work is advisory-first, senior-led, and grounded in operating reality rather than theory. |

Typical focus areas include:
- Ongoing utility engagement
- Study coordination and interpretation
